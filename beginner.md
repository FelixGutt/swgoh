How The Kenobi Alliance can help you grow
```

The Kenobi Alliance has many resources that can help you as a new or experienced player. The TKA Boot Camp is a guild within the alliance specifically designed for brand new players and experienced players with brand new accounts.

**ALLIES**
The Kenobi Alliance is currently ten guilds with players who've been playing since week one through just starting. The more established players have gotten to the point where they don't need allies anymore and are in general happy to help out new players by giving them a big ally. It can really speed up your advancement having a stable of reliced allies to draw from for finishing your light-side, dark-side and cantina battles.

Pick a handful of larger accounts from #ally-codes and send them a request. Worst case is they delete your request and move on.

**ADVICE**
The best place to go to ask questions is Discord. Many of our experienced players have multiple accounts and it is difficult to monitor the in-game chat in all the guilds we are in. However, we can easily monitor Discord as it sends us alerts. We'll do the best we can in-game but please don't take offense if we ask to take the conversation to Discord. The in-game chat does not provide a good forum for much more than announcements.

_Discord_
For guild specific questions the best place to ask questions is in the #tka-boot-camp-general channel or one of the other tka channels if about raids, territory battles, or territory wars. We can also answer questions about general play in these channels but there is also the #general-chat channel which has players from all the guilds. That channel can be kind of noisy so the best place to make sure you get heard is often the guild specific channels.

How to grow your account
```
This section has things that will help you grow your account, make your account desirable for drafting into bigger/stronger guilds, and hopefully more fun to play.

**HOW TO ASK FOR HELP**
You will get the best answers to questions about how to play the game. Asking questions about what characters or ships you should invest in will likely get you unsatisfying answers. The reason for this is most people in our alliance don't want to tell you how to play your game. It's yours and you should play it how you want to.

Good questions are:
* How do I beat XXX
* Is Zeta XXX worth it

**PICK A PATH / HAVE A PLAN**
There are several paths to start your account, and there is no one "right way". There is also the problem of change. The game is constantly evolving and the optimal paths change over time. There are charts pinned in this channel that show prerequisites for certain characters. This can help you do some planning.

Still need help? Open a conversation in Discord. We'll be happy to discuss the different paths and give advice and opinions. Just please don't ask us to tell you what to do.

**FOCUS**
This goes hand in hand with picking a path. A lot of match making in SWGOH comes down to your GP. An account with fewer larger squads will be matched against an account with more smaller squads. The more focused account is generally stronger and is going to win the match.

Focusing is hard and the game designers have built in hooks to make you want to spend money to get this or that. Even if you don't spend money, these temptations can pull you off your focused path.

**PATIENCE**
Advancing in SWGOH takes either time or money. If you choose to spend money the biggest bang for your buck is the Hyperdrive bundle while you are still a new player. If you choose to not spend money be prepared for a few months growing to level 85. My experience has been that my F2P accounts grow at about 1.5M GP per year.

What it means to be in a guild
```

Our guild is a community that leans on each other, supports each other, and gives to each other. There are a number of ways we can do this beyond just giving advice in chat.

**TERRITORY BATTLES**
Territory Battles (TB) - for players that are level 65 and above - are the sole mandatory activity to be part of this guild. We make TB required because these are a large part of supporting the team that is our guild. Sometimes one person's contributions can make the difference between getting a star and not getting it. There is more detailed information pinned in the #tka-boot-camp-tb channel.

**DAILY TICKETS**
Every time you perform a LS, DS, or Cantina battle you earn raid tickets for the guild. The three raids we will be running are: The Pit, Tank Takedown, and The Sith Triumverate. Each of these has their own ticket tracker so they will run somewhat regularly on their own schedule.

We strongly encourage raid participation as the more people who part the higher difficulty we can do in the raid. The higher difficulty the more rewards we all get for completing the raid.

Likewise we encourage players to spend their daily energy to earn more raid tickets for the guild. The maximum per day you can earn is 600. While we don't necessarily track 600's we do keep an eye on 0's.

**GEAR EXCHANGE**
There is a place in the Guild page in game for exchanging gear. The key word here is exchange. If you have a brand new account most of the gear you need other players will have in excess. Don't worry too much about "trading evenly". Once you get to higher levels, strongly consider giving back to the community by giving items you have plenty of to other people who are short items they need.

```fix
Territory Battles (part 1 - basics)
```

Territory Battles are a group event that is mandatory for all guild members level 65 and over. 

Territory battles are the primary source of Guild Event Credits which gets us gear in the Guild Event Store. The kinds of gear in this store are primarily used for higher toon gear levels. The number and quality of the rewards is based on the total number of stars we earn over the event. We earn stars by completing Combat Missions and deploying our rosters in territories.

First off, don't worry. These aren't complicated. These instructions will walk you through your first one. 

There is no join period. If the TB is active you can just jump in.

Each of the areas you can interact with will have either a gold circle or a red circle with a slash through it. The gold circle is saying, "focus here". The red circle is a "do not do this". Officers will set these commands at the beginning of each phase and will update them during the phase as things change. Look at each of the areas and note their requirements. Some of the areas will require specific units, for example Phoenix or Rebels. Officers will also post instructions too. These will be things like, "Attack here", "Wait to deploy", and "Fill these".

In general the order you should focus on things is Special Missions, Combat Missions, and then fill Platoons. Later during the phase, there will be additional instructions on where to deploy your remaining units.

You can only use a toon once per phase. They will be reset between phases. You can upgrade a toon before using it even if the TB has already started.


```fix
Territory Battles (part 2 - Missions)
```

**SPECIAL MISSIONS**
The rewards from special missions are Guild Event Tokens that can be spent in the Guild Events Store in Shipments. There is very good stuff in this store and TB is the best way to get these. To earn any GET you have to complete the special mission. If you fail in any of the waves your units will count towards getting a star in the territory but there are no other rewards.

**COMBAT MISSIONS**
The rewards from a combat mission are Territory Points. These count towards getting more stars in a territory. You earn more points for every wave completed. You do not have to win the entire mission to earn points.

**PLATOONS / GARRISONS**
In these missions you don't need to do battle. As a guild we need to provide specific units to fill "platoons". There is a star requirement for each phase. Filling these is important as it gets us bonuses in later waves that we'll need to boost the number of Territory Points we earn in later phases.

Posting Platoons is not nearly as sexy as getting a bunch of points by completing waves in Combat Missions; however, this is a team event. The better we work as a team the more rewards we will earn. If this is your first TB don't worry about whether to do Platoons or Missions...  just do something. Once you have a couple TB under your belt, you'll want to be helping fill platoons. If you are unsure whether to do a mission or fill platoons, ask an officer for direction.

No Path - No Problem
```

So after reading all the information about how we don't want to tell you how to play your game you are still thinking, "But I don't know enough about the game to know how I want to play the game!" Well, I've got you covered here.

**Characters**
Phoenix are a very good beginning team
* They're readily available at low levels
* They're not strong offensively but they're very durable
* They help with LS Hoth TB
* They are helpful with Galactic War
* With good allies they can carry you through the entire LS Battles
* They are a reasonable defensive team in TW and GAC for quite a while
* They are needed to get Thrawn and his capital ship Chimera

The Phoenix Team is:
* Hera (*) - Cantina Battles 1-F
* Garrazeb (*) - Galactic War Store
* Chopper (*) - Cantina Battles Store
* Ezra (*) - Cantina Battles 2-B
* Kanan (*) - Squad Arena Store
* Sabine - Dark Side 1-A

(*) - most common choices

Most players only take the Phoenix as far as they need to get Thrawn at 7-star and then abandon them for the other toons they've acquired using the Phoenix.

Phoenix can bootstrap you into many different paths. A reasonable next step is to build Geonosians which is a good team and gets you Padme who is the lead of another great team.

As soon as you unlock the Jango Fett node (LS 8-D), start farming it to get the Hounds Tooth (HT). It is critical to doing well in fleets. As soon as you unlock the Bossk node (DS 9-B), start farming him to pilot HT.

**Fleets**
The "best" capitol ship to focus on initially is the Executrix with Thrawn. His Fleet Challenge event gets you six Zetas a week. Zetas are good and are discussed in more detail elsewhere. If you follow the Phoenix -> Geonosians path, the side benefit is that the Geonosian ships are pretty good and work well with Tarkin.

**Disclaimers**
This approach is being offered as a reasonable way to start if you don't have a plan. There is no implied or explicit warrantee.
