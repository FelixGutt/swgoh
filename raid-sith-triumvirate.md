The Sith Triumvirate Raid
Phase 1 - Darth Nihilus
```
Darth Nihilus has an intereting mechanic in The Sith Triumvirate raid. The purple bar over his health is protection that you need to take down before you can start doing health. Unfortunately we get no points for doing damage to his protection, just health damage.

When you first enter phase 1 look to see what Nihilus' health percentage is at. If you're getting to the end of the battle (almost out of characters or his turn meter is down to 1) check to make sure you've reduced the percentage by some amount. Any amount really. If you haven't reduced his health, retreat from the combat by selecting the gear icon in the top left the screen and select "Retreat". This will allow you to try again with those characters.

The next thing you are going to notice is that Nihilus' protection keeps coming back. That happens in two ways. One is a power he uses that recovers protection. There's not much you can do about this. The other way his protection recovers is through your actions. When your characters attack him with their basic attack there is a chance they'll get a Defense Down debuff on them. That's the little red shield icon over their head. If they attack him again with their basic attack while this shield is there he will recover protection.

The way to avoid healing his protection is to have your character use one of their non-basic powers or to attack one of his minions with their basic. Only characters who can do a lot of damage should attack while they have defense down debuff.

Nihilus has a power that will insta-kill one of your characters. You can force him to kill a specific one if you have taunt. Or, one of your characters will have a blue shield over their head. They have a special power that makes all the enemies target them. They'll take damage but cannot be defeated. This will also protect your character from Nihilus' special attack.
