The Pit Raid - Overview
```
Each day you will get to take up to five teams against  Gamorean Guards or the Rancor. Your score gets added in with everone elses. Once we've done enough cumulative damage the phase ends and the next one begins. After four phases the event completes and rewards are paid out to everyone who contributed (or since we are doing a join period, had joined before the start). Rewards are based on how many points you do in the raid. First place gets a lot more rewards than 50th place so it pays to do your best in the raid.

There's a turn counter on the boss of each level. You have until this reaches 0 then the boss monsters step up their damage to rediculous levels and kill your characters. Pay attention to the turn meter and their special abilities.

Raids are what we earned the daily tickets for and really boost your resources both in direct gear rewards but also in Guild Tokens to use in Shipments.

The Pit Raid - The phases
```
**PHASE 1**
In phase 1 you will fight Gamorean Guards. Only damage against the "boss" one in the middle counts towards completing the phase. The complication is that the minion guards taunt. There are several ways to fight this wave but either doing a lot of damage to kill the minions or having area of effect attacks are a good idea.

**PHASE 2 & 3**
In these two phases we will be fighting the Rancor. It does a lot of damage, can clear buffs from your characters, and has Devour. With one exception, when the Rancor devours a character it is killed and cannot be revived. The other key thing to know about these two levels is that there is a door control on the right hand side. If you target and destroy this the door crashes down on the Rancor and immobilizes it temporarily. This can be used strategically.

**PHASE 4**
The Rancor loses the Devour ability in this phase but we lose the door control so we can no longer immobilize the Rancor. Moreover, the Rancor starts taking double turns - effectively speeding up. On the plus side when this Rancor's turn meter reaches zero you'll get a few more turns before he destroys your team.
