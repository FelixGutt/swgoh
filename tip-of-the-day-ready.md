Mods - which ones should I farm
```
There's no one mod set that you should farm. Different characters need different stats. However, there are some basic rules you can use for determining if the mod should be sold or upgraded/sliced.

**RARITY**
Mods with a rarity between 1 and 4 should be sold. They're better than nothing if you are just starting out; however, don't bother investing any resources in them. They cannot be sliced to be better than they. Rarity 5 can be sliced into better mods.

**SPEED**
Speed is very important in this game. Speed determines which character goes first and how often they get an action. In all but a limited number of cases more speed is better than less speed. When you are starting out you're going to have to use some mods with no speed bonuses but all other things being equal speed is important.

**SYNERGIES**
Typically each character has one or two defining stats. These are usually the ones suggested by the Basic Mod UI but do a quick google to find out the internets opinion. Try to find the combination of mods that through sets, primary stats, and secondary stats maximize these defining stats. If you have a mod that is all over the place, put it higher in the list of "sellable mods".

**SLOTS**
Arrow and Triangle mods are the most rare. All other things being equal sell these last. Arrow mods are the only ones that can have Speed as a primary stat. Sell these last.

**ADDITIONAL RESEARCH**
Unfortunately mods are just complicated. To get good at them you're going to have to do some independent research. I offer you the following link to help you get started.

**SUMMARY**
* Sell mods with 1-4 dots (rarity)
* Prefer mods with more speed
* Prefer focused mods (same stat in primary and seccondary)
* Be cautious selling Arrow and Triangle mods
* Go do more research

Airplane mode
```

If you are playing on a mobile device there is almost a near certainty that there is an "Airplane Mode" that you can activate that temporarily disconnects your device from the internet. This can be quite useful in a number of game modes.

What's the benefit you ask? Glad you did! If you turn on airplane mode after starting a battle you can fight it all the way to its conclusion. If you win and like the result you can disable airplane mode and click "TRY AGAIN" in the SWGoH interface. Your game will reconnect and process your results. On the other hand if you lose or don't like the results you got from winning you can close the SWGoH app, disable airplane mode, and then reopen the application. In many game modes this will leave you at the same state where you started and you can try again.

In some game modes (Territory Wars and Grand Arena Championships) if you use this technique the squad you used is still considered used and is no longer available. Despite these downsides it is still sometimes desirable to use this technique rather than losing the battle. See future tips or specific help information on those game modes for more information.

In some game modes (Squad Arena, Fleet Arena, Territory Battles) there is no benefit to using this technique.

This works for:
* Galactic War
* Raids

Does not work for:
* Squad Arena
* Fleet Arena
* Territory Battles

Partially works for:
* Territory Wars
* Grand Arena

**In Summary**
* Using airplane mode can in some cases allow you to retry a battle with no repercussions.
* Using airplane mode in Territory Wars and Grand Arena can avoid leaving opponents with preloaded turn meter

What is preloaded turn meter and why is it bad
```
In a previous TotD we talked about how not preloading turn meter was desirable in a number of game modes. What is a preloaded turn meter and why is it undesirable? Well, read on to find out.

In several game modes SWGoH remembers the state of characters and ships between battles. This is primarily in Galactic War, Territory War, and Grand Arena Championship. Since your offensive teams can only be used once in these game modes this mostly applies to defensive teams. What this does allow you to do is use several weaker teams to take out a slightly larger team by making multiple attacks against it. SWGoH remembers the defensive team's damage and turn meter. You do have to complete the battle for this to apply. If you time out or forfeit the state doesn't get saved.

From the aspect of being able to use weaker teams to take out a larger one this is a good thing. The downside is when you battle a team, don't make any progress and then lose. In this case you've left the defensive team with whatever turn meter they had when the combat ended. Any new offensive team is coming into the match with zero turn meter. This means the defensive team is likely to go first. Often times specific counters require having set your offensive team up with the right speed mods and letting the defensive team go first can wreck the team's strategy.

So, what is there to do about this? Well, if you see that you are losing and have not taken out at least one character of the defensive team, forfeit the battle. If you get a chance you can do this through the menu options, you can cause the game to pause - any number of buttons on your phone will do this - then close the game, or you can use airplane mode. (See airplane mode TotD).

When you see people reminding you to not preload turn meter, this is what they are asking you to do.
