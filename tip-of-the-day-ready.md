Mods
```
Let me start by saying, "Mods are complicated." This isn't me trying to wiggle out of opening your eyes to all the mysteries of Mods, it is just a fact. Mods are comlicated and I am not an expert on them. In fact they are too complicated to go into detail on them in a quick tip. I share a couple links at the end of this tip that I could not do justice to here.

Mods become available when you reach level 50. Mods give boosts to your character's stats and allow you to differentiate your characters from everyone else's characters. For example, I might have my Ezra modded for Speed and Critical Hit Chance and you might have yours modded for Offense and Critical Hit Damage.


**Quick tips:**
_Mod rarity 1-4 are garbage!_ Mods come with rarities as indicated by dots over the top. Anything with 1-4 dots isn't worth your time. It is better than having an empty mod slot on your character but only barely. Replace them with 5 dot mods as quickly as you can. Sell them. Have a party with the proceeds. 5 dot mods can be sliced to 6 dot mods, 1-4 dot mods cannot be sliced.

_Speed is King!_ All characters have special needs when it comes to mods. My best suggestion here is to use google. Google something like "SWGOH Geonosian Mods". You'll find a bounty of videos that will suggest the best mods. Past that, almost all characters can use some extra speed. Going first is almost always better and going more often better yet.

_Do it!_ Take the time to get your mods right. A well modded team will do much better than one with haphazard mods.

Airplane mode
```

If you are playing on a mobile device there is almost a near certainty that there is an "Airplane Mode" that you can activate that temporarily disconnects your device from the internet. This can be quite useful in a number of game modes.

What's the benefit you ask? Glad you did! If you turn on airplane mode after starting a battle you can fight it all the way to its conclusion. If you win and like the result you can disable airplane mode and click "TRY AGAIN" in the SWGoH interface. Your game will reconnect and process your results. On the other hand if you lose or don't like the results you got from winning you can close the SWGoH app, disable airplane mode, and then reopen the application. In many game modes this will leave you at the same state where you started and you can try again.

In some game modes (Territory Wars and Grand Arena Championships) if you use this technique the squad you used is still considered used and is no longer available. Despite these downsides it is still sometimes desirable to use this technique rather than losing the battle. See future tips or specific help information on those game modes for more information.

In some game modes (Squad Arena, Fleet Arena, Territory Battles) there is no benefit to using this technique.

This works for:
* Galactic War
* Raids

Does not work for:
* Squad Arena
* Fleet Arena
* Territory Battles

Partially works for:
* Territory Wars
* Grand Arena

**In Summary**
* Using airplane mode can in some cases allow you to retry a battle with no repercussions.
* Using airplane mode in Territory Wars and Grand Arena can avoid leaving opponents with preloaded turn meter

What is preloaded turn meter and why is it bad
```
In a previous TotD we talked about how not preloading turn meter was desirable in a number of game modes. What is a preloaded turn meter and why is it undesirable? Well, read on to find out.

In several game modes SWGoH remembers the state of characters and ships between battles. This is primarily in Galactic War, Territory War, and Grand Arena Championship. Since your offensive teams can only be used once in these game modes this mostly applies to defensive teams. What this does allow you to do is use several weaker teams to take out a slightly larger team by making multiple attacks against it. SWGoH remembers the defensive team's damage and turn meter. You do have to complete the battle for this to apply. If you time out or forfeit the state doesn't get saved.

From the aspect of being able to use weaker teams to take out a larger one this is a good thing. The downside is when you battle a team, don't make any progress and then lose. In this case you've left the defensive team with whatever turn meter they had when the combat ended. Any new offensive team is coming into the match with zero turn meter. This means the defensive team is likely to go first. Often times specific counters require having set your offensive team up with the right speed mods and letting the defensive team go first can wreck the team's strategy.

So, what is there to do about this? Well, if you see that you are losing and have not taken out at least one character of the defensive team, forfeit the battle. If you get a chance you can do this through the menu options, you can cause the game to pause - any number of buttons on your phone will do this - then close the game, or you can use airplane mode. (See airplane mode TotD).

When you see people reminding you to not preload turn meter, this is what they are asking you to do.
