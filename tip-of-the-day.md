Galactic War, part 1
```

The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This game mode is a series of 12 battles where you receive higher rewards the higher you reach. It is worth focusing on eary as the difficulty scales along with your player level. It will seem easy at first but will get hard once you are in your 70's and 80's. On the plus side once you get your first large team the Galactic War will be trivial.

The GW can take a lot of time to play. 12 battles at 2-5 minutes apiece means you can spend up to an hour getting through all of them. However, once you have completed finished all 12 battles 50 times you can start simming it so the time spent doing them pays back with what is a pretty good set of rewards for free every day.

While the GW is a series of 12 battles the state of your units is "remembered" between battles. If your characters are at half strength at the end of a battle, they will be at half strength at the beginning of the next battle. This means you need to manage the health of your units and use them wisely. Don't let your strongest units be weakened in earlier battles when you could use weaker units.

Bringing a team that includes a healer is a good idea. It allows you to keep your teams top notch through mutliple battles. This is another reason we suggest Phoenix as a good "first" squad. Between Chopper's and Hera's healing this team doesn't suffer the gradual weakening effect from multiple battles as badly as other squads. The downside is that they don't have a ton of offense so they can sometimes get stuck with an opponent they cannot defeat.

**In Summary**
* Take the time to do your galactic wars
* Use healers to keep your team healthy
* Use weaker teams to get through the easier battles

The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This game mode is a series of 12 battles where you receive higher rewards the higher you reach. It is worth focusing on early as the difficulty scales along with your player level. This Tip-of-the-Day has tips to help you win those harder battles.

The GW random number generator (RNG) isn't random. Or to put it a better way, it is random but it can be predictable. If you you start a battle and start to lose, retreat from the battle. When you restart the battle if you follow the exact same moves as you did the first time you will get the exact same results and the opposing team will also take the exact same moves with the same results. 

This is a big deal. You now know what's going to happen for one set of actions. Sometimes you can try a slightly different strategy and get much different results. Sometimes your first alternate strategy doesn't work and it requires multiple attempts.

If you get stuck on a node because the rng keeps picking one of yoru characters and focusing on it, try changing the order of your lineup. This can cause the rng to pick a different character, perhaps one that is disposable or perhaps one that can take the hits better.

If you get really stuck, consider sacrificing a squad to weaken the opposing squad in some way. This is a risky maneuver because you are preloading their turn meter but if you can take out a character, that might be the difference. Or, perhaps using up their special attacks might give you the breathing room you need with your main squad.

**In Summary**
* Don't lose battles, retreat instead so you don't lose your squad
* Use the fact that your opponent does the same thing every time
* Try changing the order of your lineup
* Try sacrificing a squad to get advantage

Galactic War, part 3
```
The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This Tip-of-the-Day has tips to help you win those harder battles.

In `Galactic War, part 1` we talked about how the state of your characters is preserved between battles. This includes their turn meter. If you are saving your strongest squad for later, consider using them for one of the earlier battles to "prime" their turn meter so when you get the harder battles your characters are more likely to go first.

One of the things GW is useful for is learning which characters work well against other characters. There is a lot of theory crafting in this and it can get a bit thick if you are also still trying to learn the game; however, this is a good time to start thinking about offensive strategies. Consider bringing Dooku to stun opponents, consider bring Old Ben who has ability block... This is just a sampling, give them and others a try.

As a last resort, consider sacrificing your strongest squad to get past a node. The difficulty of various nodes in GW is not neccessarily linear. I've had a crazy difficult fight on node 5, then breezed through the rest of the battles. Some of that has to do with having the right counter to the defensive squad but some is just a that SWGoH does a mediocre job of judging the challenge level of a given squad.

**In Summary**
* Prime the turn meter of your best squad
* Use appropriate counters
* Consider sacrificing your strongest squad to get past a node

Galactic War, part 4
```
The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This Tip-of-the-Day has tips to help you win those harder battles.

In `Galactic War, part 2` we talked about how the random number generator (RNG) can be predicted by watching a battle play out, retreating, then replaying the battle. One of the things you can try doing is "bumping" the RNG. Computer RNGs are really just algorithms that generate a sequence of numbers. It's just math like 1+1=2 but a little more complicated. They key part is that if the inputs are the same the same number will come out the other side. It's effectively just a list of numbers used to determine actions within the game. To "bump" or "nudge" the RNG off it's predictable path we just need to change some of the inputs.

One technique is to get the game to consume some of the random numbers. You do this by briefly enabling auto-battle. If you double-tap the "Auto-battle" button the game will need to use some of the random numbers in its list to determine what action your character takes. This will use a new set of numbers for the rest of that battle changing the outcomes. Just make sure your characters get at least one action to consume one or more of the random numbers.

You can also change the outcome of the RNG results by upgrading your characters by changing their level, gear, mods, and abilities. This allows you to change the state of the plying field (what order characters are going in, how much damage has been done, resistance to effects, etc). This changed state may cause the game to take a different action than it took the first time through the battle. This is a difficult or impossible step to undo so it's something to try after other techniques.

**In Summary**
* Bump the RNG by using auto-battle
* Change the state the game uses to determine actions by upgrading characters

Airplane mode
```

If you are playing on a mobile device there is almost a near certainty that there is an "Airplane Mode" that you can activate that temporarily disconnects your device from the internet. This can be quite useful in a number of game modes.

What's the benefit you ask? Glad you did! If you turn on airplane mode after starting a battle you can fight it all the way to its conclusion. If you win and like the result you got you can disable airplane mode and click "TRY AGAIN" in the SWGoH interface. Your game will reconnect and process your results. On the other hand if you lose or don't like the results you got from winning you can close the SWGoH app, disable airplane mode, and then reopen the application. In many game modes this will leave you at the same state where you started and you can try again.

In some game modes (Territory Wars and Grand Arena Championships) if you use this technique you lose the use of your combat and the squad you used is no longer available. Despite these downsides it is still sometimes desirable to use this technique rather than losing the battle. See future tips or specific help information on those game modes for more information.

This works for:
* Galactic War
* Raids

Does not work for:
* Squad Arena
* Fleet Arena
* Territory Battles

Partially works for:
* Territory Wars
* Grand Arena

**In Summary**
* Using airplane mode can in some cases allow you to retry a battle with no repercussions.
* Using airplane mode in Territory Wars and Grand Arena can avoid leaving opponents with preloaded turn meter

Resource Management - Maximizing Resources
```
As mentioned previously, SWGoH has a large component of resource management. One key to progressing in this game is to maximize your resources. Part of maximizing the effect of your resources is not using them on things not in your path but another large part is maximizing how many resources you get every day.

**DAILY LOGIN REWARDS**
There are daily login rewards which vary from a few credits to zetas later in the month. The character shards given during a month are okay but are rarely going to be for a character on your path. These can be considered bloat; however, later in the month you will get zetas. These are very limited in supply and you'll want to collect your daily rewards every day so you can get the late-month zeta rewards.

**GALACTIC WAR**
Winning your first 50 GW can be time consuming and annoying but once you have your 50 completions you can sim these battles every day. There are several good characters from the GW Store but even after you have everything these get converted to Shard Store currency which has important gear in it. 

**DAILY CHALLENGES**
The gear, credits, and ability mods that come from the Daily Challenges provide a significant boost to your characters when you are in the Early Game stage. They become less significant over time but these are "free" daily resources that shouldn't be ignored.

**DAILY ACTIVITIES**
Completing Daily Activities gets you some rewards for each one including experience. Completing all of them gets you a big bonus.

**ENERGY REFRESHES**
You get bonus energy three times per day (noon, 6 pm, 9 pm). Log in within 2 hours after each of these times to collect your bonus energy.

**In Summary**
* Log in every day
* Complete all your GW and Challenges daily
* Collect all your free energy

Resource Management - Effective use of Resources
```

SWGoH has a large component of resource management. There is balance between hoarding resources and using resources to get stronger in order to earn more. I've started a number of accounts and I break my resource management into a few different phases and different styles. The terms I use below are mine and are kind of loose. It's more about the general state of your account than hard and fast rules.

**EARLY GAME**
I consider the early game to be levels 1-85. My focus during these levels is getting my next level, getting a solid foundation for my characters and teams, and preparing to be a resource to a bigger guild. I'm not super worried about building up a stockpile of any particular resource. In particular I tend to spend my daily crystals every day to run more missions. Missions get me gear for my characters, they get me experience to go up in levels faster, and they get me character shards. _This gets me to mid-game faster._

**MID GAME**
Mid game can start before level 85 but realistically, while level 85 is an awesome milestone and the entirety of the game is opened up to you it isn't an end goal in and of itself. During this phase of account growth I start building up a stockpile of all the resources. I probably have my Phoenix all kitted out and am working on a second squad. I want a small reserve of Crystals, Guild Event Tokens (GET), Guild Store Tokens, and Shard Store Tokens for a rainy day. I find it particularly annoying when the piece of gear I need to finish a character is just sitting in a store and I don't have the tokens to buy it.

**LATER GAME**
This phase is out of scope for a starter guild quick tip.

**In Summary**
* Don't let hoarding resources slow your advancement in the early game
* Keep a small reserve of useful tokens and credits for rainy days
* Don't waste _any_ resources on non-critical path characters or ships

Preparing for Territory Wars and Heroic Raids
```
**HEROIC RAIDS**
We're not to Heroic level raids yet but we're going to push to get to those as quickly as we can. Raids limit which characters you can bring in based on how many stars they have. Heroic level raids require you to have at least one 7-star character or you cannot join.

We always do a 24-hour join period so that everyone has a chance to get some kind of reward even if the raid is happening at a time that isn't convenient for you.

_If you can, always sign up for a raid; otherwise, you are throwing away free resources!_

Prioritize getting at least one character to 7-star as fast as you can. If you are starting on the Phoenix path, Hera is a good choice.

**TERRITORY WARS**
We'll be doing Territory Wars very soon. These are large scale combats that are like the Squad Arena. The main difference is that we are both defending our territory as well as attacking opponents territories. In this game mode you do not get rewards unless you earn banners for the guild. You earn banners by setting a defense or winning a battle on offense. _To guarantee rewards, always set at least one defensive team!_

Characters in your roster are only eligible for Territory Wars if they are worth at least 6,000 GP. You need at least five characters to set a defense. Focus to get yourself to at least five characters worth at least 6,000 GP each so you can earn rewards.

Bloat - What is it and how it hurts you
```
We talk about bloat a lot but we don't often talk about what it is or why it is bad. This tip-of-the-Day is to help rectify that.

**WHAT IS BLOAT**
Bloat is anything that grows your GP in an unproductive way. There's lots of ways this happens:
* Activating characters/ships that you aren't going to use
* Promoting characters/ships you aren't going to use
* Leveling/enhancing characters/ships you aren't going to use
* Modding characters you aren't going to use
* Upgrading abilities of characters you aren't going to use

Yup, everything in that list has one thing in common. It's all about spending resources unproductively.

**WHY IS BLOAT BAD**
One big reason is in PvP match making. This includes Galactic War, Territory Wars, and Grand Arena Championships (GAC). GP isn't the only factor used in match making but it plays a key role. The more your GP includes characters and ships that aren't productive the less effective you will be when you are matched agains more focused opponents. In a Player vs Player (PvP) matchup the more focused player wins. This happens because given the same amount of resources spent on two squads vs one squad gives you two teams that cannot individually defeat the one larger team.

This is true of Territory Wars too. The guild that has the more focused members will tend to do better in Territory Wars.

**DO I NEED TO GIVE UP OR START OVER**
Not at all, especially if you've spent real money on this game! All accounts have some amount of bloat. Most characters are useful eventually so you will be able to grow into them and they will change from bloat to useful characters in your inventory. Because I wasn't given this tip early on, my main account has a fair amount of bloat. It is doing just fine. This tip is about helping you maximize your effectiveness and hopefully your enjoyment by feeling effective in all the game modes.
