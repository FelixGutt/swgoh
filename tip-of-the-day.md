Galactic War, part 1
```

The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This game mode is a series of 12 battles where you receive higher rewards the higher you reach. It is worth focusing on eary as the difficulty scales along with your player level. It will seem easy at first but will get hard once you are in your 70's and 80's. On the plus side once you get your first large team the Galactic War will be trivial.

The GW can take a lot of time to play. 12 battles at 2-5 minutes apiece means you can spend up to an hour getting through all of them. However, once you have completed finished all 12 battles 50 times you can start simming it so the time spent doing them pays back with what is a pretty good set of rewards for free every day.

While the GW is a series of 12 battles the state of your units is "remembered" between battles. If your characters are at half strength at the end of a battle, they will be at half strength at the beginning of the next battle. This means you need to manage the health of your units and use them wisely. Don't let your strongest units be weakened in earlier battles when you could use weaker units.

Bringing a team that includes a healer is a good idea. It allows you to keep your teams top notch through mutliple battles. This is another reason we suggest Phoenix as a good "first" squad. Between Chopper's and Hera's healing this team doesn't suffer the gradual weakening effect from multiple battles as badly as other squads. The downside is that they don't have a ton of offense so they can sometimes get stuck with an opponent they cannot defeat.

**In Summary**
* Take the time to do your galactic wars
* Use healers to keep your team healthy
* Use weaker teams to get through the easier battles

Galactic War, part 2
```

The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This game mode is a series of 12 battles where you receive higher rewards the higher you reach. It is worth focusing on eary as the difficulty scales along with your player level. It will seem easy at first but will get hard once you are in your 70's and 80's. On the plus side once you get your first large team the Galactic War will be trivial. This Tip-of-the-Day is tips to help you win those harder battles.

The GW random number generator (RNG) isn't random. Or to put it a better way, it is random but if you start a battle and start to lose. Retreat from the battle, when you restart the battle if you follow the exact same moves as you did the first time you will get the exact same results and the opposing team will also take the exact same moves with the same results. 

This may seem like it isn't that big of a deal but it means that if you lose a battle and retreat, you now have foreknowledge of what your opponent is going to do. You can try a different path and perhaps get different results.

**In Summary**
* Don't lose battles, retreat instead (use airplane mode to guarantee)
* Use the foreknowledge of what your opponent is going to do beat them

Airplane mode
```

If you are playing on a mobile device there is almost a near certainty that there is an "Airplane Mode" that you can activate that temporarily disconnects your device from the internet. This can be quite useful in a number of game modes.

What's the benefit you ask? Glad you did! If you turn on airplane mode after starting a battle you can fight it all the way to its conclusion. If you win and like the result you got you can disable airplane mode and click "TRY AGAIN" in the SWGoH interface. Your game will reconnect and process your results. On the other hand if you lose or don't like the results you got from winning you can close the SWGoH app, disable airplane mode, and then reopen the application. In many game modes this will leave you at the same state where you started and you can try again.

In some game modes (Territory Wars and Grand Arena Championships) if you use this technique you lose the use of your combat and the squad you used is no longer available. Despite these downsides it is still sometimes desirable to use this technique rather than losing the battle. See future tips or specific help information on those game modes for more information.

This works for:
* Galactic War
* Raids

Does not work for:
* Squad Arena
* Fleet Arena
* Territory Battles

Partially works for:
* Territory Wars
* Grand Arena

**In Summary**
* Using airplane mode can in some cases allow you to retry a battle with no repercussions.
* Using airplane mode in Territory Wars and Grand Arena can avoid leaving opponents with preloaded turn meter

As mentioned previously, SWGoH has a large component of resource management. One key to progressing in this game is to maximize your resources.

Resource conservation
```

SWGoH has a large component of resource management. There is balance between hoarding resources and using resources to get stronger in order to earn more. I've started a number of accounts and I break my resource management into a few different phases and different styles. The terms I use below are mine and are kind of loose. It's more about the general state of your account than hard and fast rules.

**EARLY GAME**
I consider the early game to be levels 1-85. My focus during these levels is getting my next level, getting a solid foundation for my characters and teams, and preparing to be a resource to a bigger guild. I'm not super worried about building up a stockpile of any particular resource. In particular I tend to spend my daily crystals every day to run more missions. Missions get me gear for my characters, they get me experience to go up in levels faster, and they get me character shards. _This gets me to mid-game faster._

**MID GAME**
Mid game can start before level 85 but realistically, while level 85 is an awesome milestone and the entirety of the game is opened up to you it isn't an end goal in and of itself. During this phase of account growth I start building up a stockpile of all the resources. I probably have my Phoenix all kitted out and am working on a second squad. I want a small reserve of Crystals, Guild Event Tokens (GET), Guild Store Tokens, and Shard Store Tokens for a rainy day. I find it particularly annoying when the piece of gear I need to finish a character is just sitting in a store and I don't have the tokens to buy it.

**LATER GAME**
This phase is out of scope for a starter guild quick tip.

**In Summary**
* Don't let hoarding resources slow your advancement in the early game
* Keep a small reserve of useful tokens and credits for rainy days
* Don't wast _any_ resources on non-critical path characters or ships

Preparing for Territory Wars and Heroic Raids
```

**HEROIC RAIDS**
We're not to Heroic level raids yet but we're going to push to get to those as quickly as we can. Raids limit which characters you can bring in based on how many stars they have. Heroic level raids require you to have at least one 7-star character or you cannot join.

We always do a 24-hour join period so that everyone has a chance to get some kind of reward even if the raid is happening at a time that isn't convenient for you.

_If you can, always sign up for a raid; otherwise, you are throwing away free resources!_

Prioritize getting at least one character to 7-star as fast as you can. If you are starting on the Phoenix path, Hera is a good choice.

**TERRITORY WARS**
We'll be doing Territory Wars very soon. These are large scale combats that are like the Squad Arena. The main difference is that we are both defending our territory as well as attacking opponents territories. In this game mode you do not get rewards unless you earn banners for the guild. You earn banners by setting a defense or winning a battle on offense. _To guarantee rewards, always set at least one defensive team!_

Characters in your roster are only eligible for Territory Wars if they are worth at least 6,000 GP. You need at least five characters to set a defense. Focus to get yourself to at least five characters worth at least 6,000 GP each so you can earn rewards.
