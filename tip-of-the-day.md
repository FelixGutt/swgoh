Galactic War, part 1
```

The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This game mode is a series of 12 battles where you receive higher rewards the higher you reach. It is worth focusing on eary as the difficulty scales along with your player level. It will seem easy at first but will get hard once you are in your 70's and 80's. On the plus side once you get your first large team the Galactic War will be trivial.

The GW can take a lot of time to play. 12 battles at 2-5 minutes apiece means you can spend up to an hour getting through all of them. However, once you have completed finished all 12 battles 50 times you can start simming it so the time spent doing them pays back with what is a pretty good set of rewards for free every day.

While the GW is a series of 12 battles the state of your units is "remembered" between battles. If your characters are at half strength at the end of a battle, they will be at half strength at the beginning of the next battle. This means you need to manage the health of your units and use them wisely. Don't let your strongest units be weakened in earlier battles when you could use weaker units.

Bringing a team that includes a healer is a good idea. It allows you to keep your teams top notch through mutliple battles. This is another reason we suggest Phoenix as a good "first" squad. Between Chopper's and Hera's healing this team doesn't suffer the gradual weakening effect from multiple battles as badly as other squads. The downside is that they don't have a ton of offense so they can sometimes get stuck with an opponent they cannot defeat.

**In Summary**
* Take the time to do your galactic wars
* Use healers to keep your team healthy
* Use weaker teams to get through the easier battles

The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This game mode is a series of 12 battles where you receive higher rewards the higher you reach. It is worth focusing on early as the difficulty scales along with your player level. This Tip-of-the-Day has tips to help you win those harder battles.

The GW random number generator (RNG) isn't random. Or to put it a better way, it is random but it can be predictable. If you you start a battle and start to lose, retreat from the battle. When you restart the battle if you follow the exact same moves as you did the first time you will get the exact same results and the opposing team will also take the exact same moves with the same results. 

This is a big deal. You now know what's going to happen for one set of actions. Sometimes you can try a slightly different strategy and get much different results. Sometimes your first alternate strategy doesn't work and it requires multiple attempts.

If you get stuck on a node because the rng keeps picking one of yoru characters and focusing on it, try changing the order of your lineup. This can cause the rng to pick a different character, perhaps one that is disposable or perhaps one that can take the hits better.

If you get really stuck, consider sacrificing a weaker squad to weaken the opposing squad in some way. This is a risky maneuver because you are preloading their turn meter but if you can take out a character, that might be the difference. Or, perhaps using up their special attacks might give you the breathing room you need with your main squad.

**In Summary**
* Don't lose battles, retreat instead so you don't lose your squad
* Use the fact that your opponent does the same thing every time
* Try changing the order of your lineup
* Try sacrificing a weaker squad to get advantage

Preparing for Territory Wars and Heroic Raids
```
**HEROIC RAIDS**
We're not to Heroic level raids yet but we're going to push to get to those as quickly as we can. Raids limit which characters you can bring in based on how many stars they have. Heroic level raids require you to have at least one 7-star character or you cannot join.

We always do a 24-hour join period so that everyone has a chance to get some kind of reward even if the raid is happening at a time that isn't convenient for you.

_If you can, always sign up for a raid; otherwise, you are throwing away free resources!_

Prioritize getting at least one character to 7-star as fast as you can. If you are starting on the Phoenix path, Hera is a good choice.

**TERRITORY WARS**
We'll be doing Territory Wars very soon. These are large scale combats that are like the Squad Arena. The main difference is that we are both defending our territory as well as attacking opponents territories. In this game mode you do not get rewards unless you earn banners for the guild. You earn banners by setting a defense or winning a battle on offense. _To guarantee rewards, always set at least one defensive team!_

**You need to be level 65 to join.**

Characters in your roster are only eligible for Territory Wars if they are worth at least 6,000 GP. You need at least five characters to set a defense. Focus to get yourself to at least five characters worth at least 6,000 GP each so you can earn rewards.

Galactic War, part 3
```
Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. It provides a large number of resources so it pays to focus on it. This Tip-of-the-Day has tips to help you win those harder battles.

In `Galactic War, part 1` we talked about how the state of your characters is preserved between battles. This includes their turn meter. If you are saving your strongest squad for later, consider using them for one of the earlier battles to "prime" their turn meter so when you get the harder battles your characters are more likely to go first.

One of the things GW is useful for is learning which characters work well against other characters. There is a lot of theory crafting in this and it can get a bit thick if you are also still trying to learn the game; however, this is a good time to start thinking about offensive strategies. For example consider if the problem you have is your opponents healing faster than you can hirt them consider bringing Dooku as a leader to inflict healing immunity. Need to slow down an opponent that is inflicting a lot of special debuffs on you right off the bat, consider bring Old Ben who has ability block... This is just a sampling, give them and others a try.

As a last resort, consider sacrificing your strongest squad to get past a node. The difficulty of various nodes in GW is not neccessarily linear. I've had a crazy difficult fight on node 5, then breezed through the rest of the battles. Some of that has to do with having the right counter to the defensive squad but some is just a that SWGoH does a mediocre job of judging the challenge level of a given squad.

**In Summary**
* Prime the turn meter of your best squad
* Use appropriate counters
* Consider sacrificing your strongest squad to get past a node

Galactic War, part 4
```
The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This Tip-of-the-Day has tips to help you win those harder battles.

In `Galactic War, part 2` we talked about how the random number generator (RNG) can be predicted by watching a battle play out, retreating, then replaying the battle. One of the things you can try doing is "bumping" the RNG. Computer RNGs are really just algorithms that generate a sequence of numbers. It's just math like 1+1=2 but a little more complicated. They key part is that if the inputs are the same the same number will come out the other side. It's effectively just a list of numbers used to determine actions within the game. To "bump" or "nudge" the RNG off it's predictable path we just need to change some of the inputs.

One technique is to get the game to consume some of the random numbers. You do this by briefly enabling auto-battle. If you double-tap the "Auto-battle" button the game will need to use some of the random numbers in its list to determine what action your character takes. This will use a new set of numbers for the rest of that battle changing the outcomes. Just make sure your characters get at least one action to consume one or more of the random numbers.

You can also change the outcome of the RNG results by upgrading your characters by changing their level, gear, mods, and abilities. This allows you to change the state of the plying field (what order characters are going in, how much damage has been done, resistance to effects, etc). This changed state may cause the game to take a different action than it took the first time through the battle. This is a difficult or impossible step to undo so it's something to try after other techniques.

**In Summary**
* Bump the RNG by using auto-battle
* Change the state the game uses to determine actions by upgrading characters

Galactic War, summation
```
The Galactic War (GW) is available once you turn level 40. This Tip-of-the-Day has a summary of the tips and tricks from `Galactic War, part 1 - 4`.

**GALACTIC WAR, PART 1**
* Take the time to do your galactic wars, these get you important rewards
* Use healers to keep your team healthy, this will allow your good teams to do more battles
* Use weaker teams to get through the easier battles, this preserves your better teams for harder battles

**GALACTIC WAR, PART 2**
* Don't lose battles, retreat instead so you don't lose your squad, and worse, preload their turn meter
* Use the fact that your opponent does the same thing every time
* Try changing the order of your lineup
* Try sacrificing a weaker squad to get advantage by taking out one or more characters in the opposing squad

**GALACTIC WAR, PART 3**
* Prime the turn meter of your best squad
* Use appropriate counters
* Consider sacrificing your strongest squad to get past a node

**GALACTIC WAR, PART 4**
* Bump the RNG by using auto-battle
* Change the state the game uses to determine actions by upgrading characters

**GALACTIC WAR, ADDENDUM**
* When you get close to the end of any given battle, switch to just using basic attacks to finish it off. This way all your cooldowns have a chance to reset so you can use them right away in the next battle.
* If you get stuck and have already reset GW for the day, wait overnight and try again. You might gain a level or upgrade a character that will make the difference. If you haven't reset, give it your best effort then reset so you don't lose resources.

Communication and how it makes the guild work
```
Communication is important in any relationship and the TKA Boot Camp guild isn't any different. There are a couple of key points of communication that will make our guild the fabulous place we all want it to be.

**Messages from officers**
We try to keep "official" messages to a minimum; however, if we've tagged a message with `@TKA Boot Camp` please take time to read it to make sure it isn't relevant to you. When we start doing Territory Wars there will be communication in Discord about our plan and there will be directions in each territory during the war. Please read these and follow officer directions.

If we've reached out to you directly either in Discord or in game please respond. If we do not get a response we cannot resolve any issue we might be trying to understand and a likely result could be your account being removed from the guild.

**Player participation messages**
We have a channel #tka-boot-camp-absence for notifying the guild/officers if you have any reason to need to be away from the game. We appreciate your privacy. We don't need a reason for your absence, just a notification with an expected start and end date. If you don't feel comfortable sharing your absence on the guild absence channel, reach out to any guild officer directly. We will be happy to work with you for any extended absences (months).

**Provide Constructive Feedback**
We all have lives outside of SWGoH and are doing this on our own time because we love the game and sharing our love with others. If there is anything you'd like to see changed please just reach out either in one of our guild channels or if you are more comfortable, directly with any of the guild officers. Constructive, polite feedback will always be accepted in kind. We want this starter guild to be a fun place for everyone to come and relax and share their love of Star Wars and this game.

Resource Management - Maximizing Resources
```
As mentioned previously, SWGoH has a large component of resource management. One key to progressing in this game is to maximize your resources. Part of maximizing the effect of your resources is not using them on things not in your critical path but another large part is maximizing how many resources you get every day. Maximizing resources makes you stronger in Squad Arena and Fleet Arena which increases your rewards which makes you stronger yet.

**DAILY LOGIN REWARDS**
There are daily login rewards which vary from a few credits to zetas later in the month. The character shards given during a month are okay but are rarely going to be for a character on your path. Zetas are very limited in supply and you'll want to collect your daily rewards every day so you can get the late-month zeta rewards. The crystal rewards aren't bad either.

**GALACTIC WAR**
Winning your first 50 GW can be time consuming and annoying but once you have your 50 completions you can sim these battles every day. There are several good characters from the GW Store but even after you have everything these get converted to Shard Store currency which has important gear in it. 

**DAILY CHALLENGES**
The gear, credits, and ability mods that come from the Daily Challenges provide a significant boost to your characters when you are in the Early Game stage. They become less significant over time but these are "free" daily resources that shouldn't be ignored.

**DAILY ACTIVITIES**
Completing Daily Activities gets you some rewards for each one including experience. Completing all of them gets you a big bonus.

**ENERGY REFRESHES**
You get bonus energy three times per day (noon, 6 pm, 9 pm). Log in within 2 hours after each of these times to collect your bonus energy.

**In Summary**
* Log in every day
* Complete all your GW and Daily Challenges every day
* Collect all your free energy

Resource Management - Effective use of Resources
```
SWGoH has a large component of resource management. There is balance between hoarding resources and using resources to get stronger in order to earn more. I've started a number of accounts and I break my resource management into a few different phases and different styles. The terms I use below are mine and are kind of loose. It's more about the general state of your account than hard and fast rules.

**EARLY GAME**
I consider the early game to be levels 1-84. My focus during these levels is getting my next level, getting a solid foundation for my characters and teams, and preparing to be a resource to a bigger guild. I'm not super worried about building up a stockpile of any particular resource. In particular I tend to spend my daily crystals every day to run more missions. Missions get me gear for my characters, they get me experience to go up in levels faster, and they get me character shards. _All this gets me to mid-game faster._

_Goals:_ 
* Grow my levels as quickly as possible

**MID GAME**
Mid game can start before level 85 but this is when the whole game is opened up to you. My goals shift from growing my level to finishing my first non-Phoenix team. Phoenix are a great starter team but are abandoned by most people as soon as they have 7-star Thrawn. This next team is likely to be darkside to balance the Phoenix light side. I try to grow this second team to G13 and beyond.

I also start building a reserve of resources. I spend just enough Crystals per day to get my 600 raid tickets. I still remain focused on one team at a time. While growing my second team to G13 I am accumulating gear and other resources so the next team will grow faster.

_Goals:_
* Get 7-star Thrawn and abandon Phoenix
* Build second team to r5
* Start building resource reserves

**LATER GAME**
This phase is out of scope for a starter guild quick tip.

Airplane mode
```

If you are playing on a mobile device there is almost a near certainty that there is an "Airplane Mode" that you can activate that temporarily disconnects your device from the internet. This can be quite useful in a number of game modes.

What's the benefit you ask? Glad you did! If you turn on airplane mode after starting a battle you can fight it all the way to its conclusion. If you win and like the result you can disable airplane mode and click "TRY AGAIN" in the SWGoH interface. Your game will reconnect and process your results. On the other hand if you lose or don't like the results you got from winning you can close the SWGoH app, disable airplane mode, and then reopen the application. In many game modes this will leave you at the same state where you started and you can try again.

In some game modes (Territory Wars and Grand Arena Championships) if you use this technique the squad you used is still considered used and is no longer available. Despite these downsides it is still sometimes desirable to use this technique rather than losing the battle. See future tips or specific help information on those game modes for more information.

In some game modes (Squad Arena, Fleet Arena, Territory Battles) there is no benefit to using this technique.

This works for:
* Galactic War
* Raids

Does not work for:
* Squad Arena
* Fleet Arena
* Territory Battles

Partially works for:
* Territory Wars
* Grand Arena

**In Summary**
* Using airplane mode can in some cases allow you to retry a battle with no repercussions.
* Using airplane mode in Territory Wars and Grand Arena can avoid leaving opponents with preloaded turn meter

Bloat - What is it and how it hurts you
```
We talk about bloat a lot but we don't often talk about what it is or why it is bad. This tip-of-the-day is to help rectify that.

**WHAT IS BLOAT**
Bloat is anything that grows your GP in an unproductive way. There's lots of ways this happens:
* Activating characters/ships that you aren't going to use
* Promoting characters/ships you aren't going to use
* Leveling/enhancing characters/ships you aren't going to use
* Modding characters you aren't going to use
* Upgrading abilities of characters you aren't going to use


**WHY IS BLOAT BAD**
One big reason is in PvP match making. This includes Galactic War, Territory Wars, and Grand Arena Championships (GAC). GP isn't the only factor used in match making but it plays a key role. The more your GP includes characters and ships that aren't productive the less effective you will be when you are matched agains more focused opponents. In a Player vs Player (PvP) matchup the more focused player wins. This happens because given the same amount of resources spent on two squads vs one squad gives you two teams that cannot individually defeat the one larger team.

This is true of Territory Wars too. The guild that has the more focused members will tend to do better in Territory Wars.

**DO I NEED TO GIVE UP OR START OVER**
Not at all, especially if you've spent real money on this game! All accounts have some amount of bloat. Most characters are useful eventually so you will be able to grow into them and they will change from bloat to useful characters. Because I wasn't given this tip early on, my main account has a fair amount of bloat. It is doing just fine. This tip is about helping you maximize your effectiveness and hopefully your enjoyment by feeling effective in all the game modes.

Mods
```
Let me start by saying, "Mods are complicated." This isn't me trying to wiggle out of opening your eyes to all the mysteries of Mods, it is just a fact. Mods are comlicated and I am not an expert on them. In fact they are too complicated to go into detail on them in a quick tip.

Mods become available when you reach level 50. Mods give boosts to your character's stats and allow you to differentiate your characters from everyone else's characters. For example, I might have my Ezra modded for Speed and Critical Hit Chance and you might have yours modded for Offense and Critical Hit Damage.


**Quick tips:**
_Mod rarity 1-4 are garbage!_ Mods come with rarities as indicated by dots over the top. Anything with 1-4 dots isn't worth your time. It is better than having an empty mod slot on your character but only barely. Replace them with 5 dot mods as quickly as you can. Sell them. Have a party with the proceeds. 5 dot mods can be sliced to 6 dot mods, 1-4 dot mods cannot be sliced.

_Speed is King!_ All characters have special needs when it comes to mods. My best suggestion here is to use google. Google something like "SWGOH Geonosian Mods". You'll find a bounty of videos that will suggest the best mods. Past that, almost all characters can use some extra speed. Going first is almost always better and going more often better yet.

_Do it!_ Take the time to get your mods right. A well modded team will do much better than one with haphazard mods.

What is preloaded turn meter and why is it bad
```
In a previous TotD we talked about how not preloading turn meter was desirable in a number of game modes. What is a preloaded turn meter and why is it undesirable? Well, read on to find out.

In several game modes SWGoH remembers the state of characters and ships between battles. This is primarily in Galactic War, Territory War, and Grand Arena Championship. Since your offensive teams can only be used once in these game modes this mostly applies to defensive teams. What this does allow you to do is use several weaker teams to take out a slightly larger team by making multiple attacks against it. SWGoH remembers the defensive team's damage and turn meter. You do have to complete the battle for this to apply. If you time out or forfeit the state doesn't get saved.

From the aspect of being able to use weaker teams to take out a larger one this is a good thing. The downside is when you battle a team, don't make any progress and then lose. In this case you've left the defensive team with whatever turn meter they had when the combat ended. Any new offensive team is coming into the match with zero turn meter. This means the defensive team is likely to go first. Often times specific counters require having set your offensive team up with the right speed mods and letting the defensive team go first can wreck the team's strategy.

So, what is there to do about this? Well, if you see that you are losing and have not taken out at least one character of the defensive team, forfeit the battle. If you get a chance you can do this through the menu options, you can cause the game to pause - any number of buttons on your phone will do this - then close the game, or you can use airplane mode. (See airplane mode TotD).

When you see people reminding you to not preload turn meter, this is what they are asking you to do.

Making SWGoH more fun
```
Hold onto your socks, we're going to get philisophical in this tip.


It's a game so it should be fun, right? Well, the game is fun to many people. Other people find it a chore and even though their love of Star Wars caused them to travel to Disney and spend $200 USD to build a light saber, they still don't like this game. That's okay. Everything isn't for everyone.

do i need to spend money
what characters should i farm



That's a hard one to answer and most players who aren't narcissistic will say, "do whatever you want". This leaves you feeling like your question wasn't answered but the long answer is, "There are so many good paths, I don't want to presume to pick the right one for you." On top of that is that the best path for you is what you find enjoyable. Try asking the question a different way. Try something like, "Count Dooku is the jam on my peanut butter sandwich! How can I make this work?"

But really what the question comes down to is, what characters will you enjoy farming? Ones that are super effective? Ones that bring back childhood memories (yes, I did see Star Wars in the theater when it first came out)? In other words, you don't have to farm the characters I or anyone else tells you to. It's your game. Play it how you want to.
