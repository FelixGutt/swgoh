How come I can't get more allies
```

Your "Pending" allies is full. Go remove pending allies. Also, don't invite anyone to be an ally who isn't in a guild. It is probably an abandoned account.

Making SWGoH more fun
```
Hold onto your socks, we're going to get philisophical in this tip.


It's a game so it should be fun, right? Well, the game is fun to many people. Other people find it a chore and even though their love of Star Wars caused them to travel to Disney and spend $200 USD to build a light saber, they still don't like this game. That's okay. Everything isn't for everyone.

do i need to spend money
what characters should i farm



That's a hard one to answer and most players who aren't narcissistic will say, "do whatever you want". This leaves you feeling like your question wasn't answered but the long answer is, "There are so many good paths, I don't want to presume to pick the right one for you." On top of that is that the best path for you is what you find enjoyable. Try asking the question a different way. Try something like, "Count Dooku is the jam on my peanut butter sandwich! How can I make this work?"

But really what the question comes down to is, what characters will you enjoy farming? Ones that are super effective? Ones that bring back childhood memories (yes, I did see Star Wars in the theater when it first came out)? In other words, you don't have to farm the characters I or anyone else tells you to. It's your game. Play it how you want to.
