Mods - which ones should I farm
```
There's no one mod set that you should farm. All the different kinds are needed by different characters. However, there are some heuristics you can use for determining if the mod should be sold or upgraded/sliced.

**RARITY**
Mods with a rarity between 1 and 4 should be sold. They're better than nothing if you are just starting out; however, don't bother investing any resources in them. They cannot be sliced to be better than they are so they are capped. Rarity 5 can be spliced into rarity 6 mods.

**SPEED**
Speed is very important in this game. Speed determines which character goes first and how often they get an action. In all but a limited number of cases more speed is better than less speed. Again, when you are starting out you're going to have to use some mods with no speed bonuses but all other things being equal speed is important.

**SYNERGIES**
When you are modding a character typically there are just one or two stats that are important. The mod is going to have a set, a primary stat and four secondary stats. The more of these you can get to be the same, the better. If the mod is all over the place it will be less useful.

**SLOTS**
Arrow and Triangle mods are the most rare. Sell them last, all other things being equal. Arrow mods are the only ones that can have Speed as a primary stat. Sell these last.

**ADDITIONAL RESEARCH**
Unfortunately mods are just complicated. To get good at them you're going to have to do some independent research. I offer you the following link to help you get started.
https://wiki.swgoh.help/wiki/Mods

**SUMMARY**
* Sell mods with 1-4 dots (rarity)
* Prefer mods with more speed
* Prefer focused mods (same stat in primary and seccondary)
* Be cautious sellint Arrow and Triangle mods
* Go do more research

How come I can't get more allies
```

Your "Pending" allies is full. Go remove pending allies. Also, don't invite anyone to be an ally who isn't in a guild. It is probably an abandoned account.

Making SWGoH more fun
```
Hold onto your socks, we're going to get philisophical in this tip.


It's a game so it should be fun, right? Well, the game is fun to many people. Other people find it a chore and even though their love of Star Wars caused them to travel to Disney and spend $200 USD to build a light saber, they still don't like this game. That's okay. Everything isn't for everyone.

do i need to spend money
what characters should i farm



That's a hard one to answer and most players who aren't narcissistic will say, "do whatever you want". This leaves you feeling like your question wasn't answered but the long answer is, "There are so many good paths, I don't want to presume to pick the right one for you." On top of that is that the best path for you is what you find enjoyable. Try asking the question a different way. Try something like, "Count Dooku is the jam on my peanut butter sandwich! How can I make this work?"

But really what the question comes down to is, what characters will you enjoy farming? Ones that are super effective? Ones that bring back childhood memories (yes, I did see Star Wars in the theater when it first came out)? In other words, you don't have to farm the characters I or anyone else tells you to. It's your game. Play it how you want to.
